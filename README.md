## H, I'm Rosa 🌿

Game developer & HKU lecturer working at the intersection of real-time graphics, procedural content generation and tiny chaotic experiments.  
I build tools, prototypes, and procedural worlds — usually in Unity, sometimes in other environments for fun (and pain).

### What I do
- 🎮 Game development (Unity, C#)
- 🌈 Real-time graphics & rendering experiments
- 🏰 Exploratory procedural content generation 
- 🧩 Systems, tools, automation  
- 🎓 Teaching game students how to think, build, and break things

### Current experiments
- Prototyping for [Serentiy Sketch](.https://meditativegames.itch.io/serenitysketch)
- Procedural generation with grammars  
- Notion widgets from scratch (no paywalls, only vibes)  
- DirectX 11 rendering sandbox  
- Forever improving assignments for my students (and making my own solutions) 
- Anything that feels a little too ambitious but irresistible

### Other joys
Plants, cats, embroidery, chamomile tea, cozy aesthetics, math, reading, and making complex concepts make sense.
